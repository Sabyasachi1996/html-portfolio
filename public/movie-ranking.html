<h1>The Best Movies According to Sunny</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
  The dual character of a human being and showing that twist at the end is quite
  awesome to me.
</p>
<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
<p>
  The incredible acting of Kevin Spacy, the whole plot to keep us all thinking
  about who the actual culprit is. And finally the twist at the end which will
  blow your mind!
</p>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>
  A simple story of Antonio Montana, an immigrant turned gangster/smuggler and
  an eventual fall of him due to his hunger of power and money.Awesome acting by
  Al Pacino.
